# SQL-C#-DoctorWhoViewer
You will need to prepare for this part of the lab, by creating a Doctor Who Database using SQL Express (as per your COMP-CO859 - Database Theory course). 
Don't worry, you don't need to create the database from scratch.  You must create it using CreateDoctorWhoDatabase.SQL attach above. Just make sure that you have 
the SQL Server (SQLEXPRESS) service running first.  Then open Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio, drag the script file onto it, and click the Execute button.
